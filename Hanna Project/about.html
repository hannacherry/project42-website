        This Organization will serve as a scholarship fund as well as comumnity outreach. This will be our family's way of keeping A.J.'s name and memory alive. A.j. loved people and this is our way of keeping in part of helping others. Life is a project, never stop working on yourself.

            The goals for Project 42 are to adopt a school to help with school supplies, partner with Eagle's Nest to help needs within our school community, and partner with a local organization for help at Christmas.

            There are lots of ways to contribute to the project as well. We plan to update everyone on different charitable events such as raffles, dinner/silent auctions, and 5k runs. Of course, these are just a few funraisers that will be held. Be on the look out for updates on more events!
